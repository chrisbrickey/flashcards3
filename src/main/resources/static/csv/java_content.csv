Is ArrayList a generic?,It depends. If you don't specify the type of contents when you declare it then it is not a generic (e.g. ArrayList a = new ArrayList();) because you could literally add anything into and then when you remove something you need to cast it to a type (String s = (String) myList.get(0);); But if you assign a type at instantiation then it is a generic (e.g. ArrayList<Employee> staff = new ArrayList<Employee>();) - you don't have to downcast when retrieving an object from this,java data structures
Create a new ArrayList of Strings.,List&ltString&gt myList = new ArrayList&ltString&gt();...really important to only use the actual class (ArrayList) when using 'new' and to use the interface (List) when defining the reference.,java data structures
Create a 2D ArrayList of Integers.,List<List<Integer>> listOfLists = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>(); ,java data structures
How do you know which interface to use for the reference when instantiating some object?,always use the most abstract interface possible (e.g. choose Collection instead of ArrayList b/c the latter is more specific),java data structures
How do you add elements to an ArrayList and at what position will they be added by default?,myList.add(80) - the 80 will go to the first unassigned spot (e.g. if myList is ["hello"]; myList.add("goodbye") ... then myList is ["hello"` "goodbye"]),java data structures
Add an element to an ArrayList in the middle of the list (instead of to the end).,myList.add(index` value) - everything in the list after the index will shift to the right,java data structures
Given an ArrayList that looks like [95` 80` 72] add an element to the front of the array.,myList.add(0` 100),java data structures
Isolate one element of an ArrayList.,myList.get(index);,java data structures
Get the index of the first occurrence and last occurrence of an object in a List.,myList.indexOf(someObject) and myList.lastIndexOf(someObject),java data structures
